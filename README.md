  ## Application of BenchPDM
  ** BenchPDM ** is a benchmark for pattern-assisted microservice-based system (PAMBS) consisting of two important modules PBMC and PDM-ES.
  ### PBMC Module
  Pattern-based microservice systems creator (PBMC), is capable of generating microservice-based systems that communicate with each other through various microservice patterns, each serving a different purpose.
