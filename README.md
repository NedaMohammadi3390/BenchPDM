  ## Application of BenchPDM
  **BenchPDM**  is a benchmark for pattern-assisted microservice-based system (PAMBS) consisting of two important modules **PBMC** and **PDM-ES**.

  
  ### PBMC Module
  
  Pattern-based microservice systems creator **(PBMC)** module, is capable of generating microservice-based systems that communicate with each other through various microservice patterns, each serving a different purpose.


  ### PDM-ES Module
  
  The PDM Evaluation System **(PDM-ES)** module, is responsible for evaluating pattern detection methods based on common evaluation metrics in the field of design pattern detection. This part allows for the evaluation and comparison of different PDMs at different levels of complexity.
  

## Installation_of_the_PBMC_Module
+  ŸêYou need to specify the JavaFX module path when running the application on your local system. Use the following command:

  ```bash
    java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar PBMC.jar
  ```

+ Ensure you replace ==/path/to/javafx-sdk/lib== with the correct path to the JavaFX SDK on your machine.
+ After executing the above command, the PBMC module will be displayed as follows.
